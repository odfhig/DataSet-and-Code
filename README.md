The `code.m` serves as the main body of the code, encompassing the primary workflow of the experiment. `syncsignal.m` is responsible for generating the synchronization signal, while `denoisesignal.m` and `sec_channel.m` handle noise reduction. The noise reduction process involves implementing denoising techniques. `matchfilter.m` is utilized for matched filtering. The function `get_range_and_energy.m` is employed to acquire reference distance and energy information, essential for calculating ECF (Energy Compaction Factor). `range_compensation.m` and `com_energy.m` are employed to compensate for distance and energy, respectively. Lastly, `feature_extraction.m` is responsible for implementing the feature extraction functionality. 'model.kt' is the Kotlin-based neural network design portion.
